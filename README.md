## dmcquade.vercel.app

Hi, my name is Dillon. This is the source code to [my portfolio page](https://dmcquade.vercel.app).
Here's some info about how I made it:

- It's written in react
- The styling is done with styled-components
- The theme is based on [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme colors
- The icons are from [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- Deployed on Vercel
