## dmcquade.vercel.app

Hi, my name is Dillon. I'm an aspiring full-stack engineer. This is the source code to ![my portfolio page](https://dmcquade.vercel.app).
Here's some info about how I made it:

- It's written in react
- The styling is done with styled-components
- The theme is based on ![nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme colors
- The icons are from ![react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- Deployed on Vercel

### Run it locally:

### Clone it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dillonkmcquade/dmcquade.git
cd dmcquade
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

### npm

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
