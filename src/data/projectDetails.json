Knowing the timestamp of the data, I could refetch fresh data if it became stale after 5 minutes.\n Calculating total value involved knowing the current price of every stock in your portfolio, and this could get costly the larger the portfolio grows.\n Having the ability to store prices locally greatly reduced the number of fetch calls to finnhub.",
